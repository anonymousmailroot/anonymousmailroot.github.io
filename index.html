<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I am <strong>Divyansh Bhatia</strong>, and I am a fourth-year student currently pursuing Cyber Security and Digital Forensics at VIT Bhopal University. I am presently leading the production of the department’s yearly magazine, CyberZine. My tasks include guiding the team and managing the editing process of the magazine. I also write the Anonymous Mail blog, which comprises theoretical and technological concepts in computer science, specifically cybersecurity. Technical writing and editing is my passion. I love dealing with errors, and I aspire to lead a system administration team in the future that helps people work out technical issues with their computer systems.</p>
